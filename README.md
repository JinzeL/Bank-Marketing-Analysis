# Bank-Marketing-Analysis
Find the best strategies to improve for the next marketing campaign. How can the financial institution have a greater effectiveness for future marketing campaigns? In order to answer this, we have to analyze the last marketing campaign the bank performed and identify the patterns that will help us find conclusions in order to develop future strategies.
The three main questions answered in this project are:
Question 1: Is the account balance related to education level?
Question 2: What make your customer default?
Question 3: How to acquire more deposits for your bank?
### Summary of the results (takeaways)
1. Pay attention to customers who engaged in the last campaign and made a deposit. We usually will guess that those customers will not make deposits in the consecutive campaigns. But we are wrong. Those customers will be high likely to participate in your new campaign.
2. Try to make customers more engaged during the contact. Banks should do more research about the customer before the contact. If you make your customer willing to talk with your more than 8 minutes, you may get a new deposit.
3. Choose a right time to conduct the campaign. The project result shows us itâ€™s better to start a campaign in March or October. Only 10%-20% customers will say no to you during these months.

3. marital: marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)

10. day: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
11. duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.

#### other attributes:
12. campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
13. pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14. previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
15. poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')

### Output variable (desired target)
21. deposit: has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
